### Architecture Overview

ValueTime follows a modular architecture pattern to make the codebase maintainable and extensible:

- **Core Components (`app/components/`)**: Reusable UI components that handle specific features like timers, settings panels, and onboarding flows.

- **State Management (`app/managers/`)**: Service modules that handle specific functionality:

  - `timerManager.js`: Core timer logic and custom timer handling
  - `quoteManager.js`: Fetches and rotates motivational quotes
  - `themeManager.js`: Handles theme switching between light/dark modes
  - `storageManager.js`: Manages persistent data using Chrome's storage API
  - `settingsManager.js`: User preferences and configuration
  - `uiManager.js`: Controls UI updates and interactions

- **Page Controllers (`app/pages/`)**: Orchestrate components and manage page-specific logic for main view, settings, and onboarding.

- **Utilities (`app/utils/`)**: Shared helper functions, constants, DOM manipulation, and an event bus for communication between modules.

- **Entry Points**:
  - `home.html`: Main extension page that loads when opening a new tab
  - `app.js`: Application bootstrap that initializes the extension
  - `timeapp.js`: Core time calculation and display logic
