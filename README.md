It is a web page which replaces new tab.
It displays time remaining in the day, so as to keep one motivated 
to complete his goals and prevent him to waste any time. In short, it is kind of inverse clock.

It is available on Chrome Store as <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/valuetime/badapfgpjjaagnahmlfkhpomblifhiaj?hl=en-US">Value Time</a>.
