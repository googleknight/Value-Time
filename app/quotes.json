  "You may delay, but time will not.",
  "If you spend too much time thinking about a thing, you'll never get it done.",
  "Know the true value of time; snatch, seize, and enjoy every moment of it. No idleness, no laziness, no procrastination: never put off till tomorrow what you can do today.",
  "Your future is created by what you do today, not tomorrow.",
  "The time will pass away, you can either spend it creating the life you want or spend it living the life you don't want. The choice is yours.",
  "Amateurs sit and wait for inspiration, the rest of us just get up and go to work."
